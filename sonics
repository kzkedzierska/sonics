SONiCS - Stutter mONte Carlo Simulation. SONiCS is a stutter correction
algorithm based on derivative of Monte Carlo approach. Briefly, SONiCS models
independent PCR reactions where set of reaction parameters including the
efficiency of amplification, efficiency of capture, and the probability of
polymerase slippage modeled separately for insertions and deletions are drawn
from weak uniform priors based on experimental observations or user inputs.
Initial alleles are chosen randomly. For each simulation sonics assigns log-
likelihood (lnL) value describing the probability of generating the input
readout from the PCR pool created in a given simulation. When a certain number
of simulations are generated Mann-Whitney U test between the lnL distributions
is performed and lnL ratios are calculated (for maximal and 75th percentile
values). If the conditions of the successful run are not met SONiCS performs
additional simulations until the maximum number of repetitions is reached, or
it can call a genotype. As a result, program reports the called genotype
together with descriptors of the best model. SONiCS can also be run in
strictly Monte Carlo mode (with the option --monte_carlo). For more look in
the README file.

positional arguments:
  INPUT                 Either:allele composition - number of reads per
                        allele, example: all1|reads;all2|reads or path to a
                        VCF file if run with --vcf_mode option

                        Directory where output files will be stored. Warning:
                        SONiCS will overwrite results from previous runs
                        stored in the same directory if the file name won't be
                        changed. Default: .

                        by the main sonics process and 0 means that SONiCS
                        won't lunch additional processes. This option is valid

                        comprise more than the maximum fraction threshold of
                        the initial PCR pool (before first amplification).

                        cycles. The formula stands as follows: min_strs =
                        max(1, min(alleles_in_input) - n_floor), where alleles
                        are expressed as the number of repetitions of the

  -m, --vcf_mode        VCF file provided. Assuming that different samples, if
                        more than one is present, are put in the consecutive
                        columns, starting with 10th. Default: string mode.
