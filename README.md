# SONiCS - Stutter mONte Carlo Simulation

## SUMMARY

SONiCS performs Monte Carlo simulations of the PCR of Short Tandem Repeats, calculates the likelihood of generating given support read out (reads per allele) out of the PCR pool and determines the most probable genotype based on the log likelihood distributions.

## REQUIREMENTS

* Python version >= 3.4 
* Cython
* Python modules: 
  * numpy, 
  * pandas, 
  * scipy, 
  * pymc

## INSTALLATION

In order to configure the script run the install.sh script. If more than one python3 installed supply the path for the python version. Script will check for all dependencies and inform you if some are missing. After installation it will run a simple test and report on whether everything is working as expected.

```bash
bash install.sh [PATH_TO_PYTHON3]
```

## RUNNING SONiCS

```bash
#example run
python3 sonics "8|5;9|113;10|89"
```

## DESCRIPTION

SONiCS - Stutter mONte Carlo Simulation.

![Schematic](figure.png)

SONiCS is a stutter correction algorithm based on derivative of Monte Carlo approach. Briefly, SONiCS models independent PCR reactions where set of reaction parameters including the efficiency of amplification, efficiency of capture, and the probability of polymerase slippage modeled separately for insertions and deletions are drawn from weak uniform priors based on experimental observations or user inputs. Initial alleles are chosen randomly. For each simulation sonics assigns log-likelihood (lnL) value describing the probability of generating the input readout from the PCR pool created in a given simulation. When a certain number of simulations are generated Mann-Whitney U test between the lnL distributions is performed and lnL ratios are calculated (for maximal and 75th percentile values). If the conditions of the successful run are not met SONiCS performs additional simulations until the maximum number of repetitions is reached, or it can call a genotype. As a result, program reports the called genotype together with descriptors of the best model. SONiCS can also be run in strictly Monte Carlo mode (with the option --monte_carlo). For more details look below.

### INPUT

SONiCS accepts either the string genotype having alleles, marked as number of repeats per molecule, and number of supporting them reads in the following format: allele1|reads;allele2|reads;allele3|reads or a **VCF file** with one genotype per line and genotypes for samples in the consecutive columns starting with 9th.

Examples:

* string genotype: "5|1;6|1;7|5;8|11;9|20;10|24;11|2;12|1"
* VCF file (lorem_ipsum marks additional information that can be in the file but won't be used)

```

### OUTPUT

The output is saved to sonics_out.txt file in the output directory. It has the following columns: 
* sample, block and reference for the locus; 
* genotype called by sonics;
* descriptors: identity, r^2 and log likelihood of the best model;
* filter column - possible values:
	*  PASS - all conditions are met;
	*  no_simulations - SONiCS did not run simulations, only one allele in the input readout;
	*  no_success - no simulation generated a PCR pool from which the input readout could be generated (this can happen with very noisy genotypes, increasing the noise ratio might help in those cases);
	*  MWU_test - p-value from Mann-Whitney U test was above the threshold;
	*  best_ratio - ratio of the best log-likelihoods from two best genotypes was below the threshold;
	*  median_ratio - ratio of the median log-likelihoods from two best genotypes was below the threshold.
* highest p-value from Mann-Whitney U test;
* ratio between maximal log-likelihood (lnL) of the two best genotypes;
* ratio between 75th percentile lnL of the two best genotypes;
* number of run repetitions.
* additional ratios calculated.

### MODES

#### Monte Carlo
SONiCS can be run in strictly Monte Carlo mode with **--monte_carlo** mode. That means that SONiCS will not stop and won't test the lnL distributions or ratio. It will report the values of descriptors for best model (maximal and the 75th percentile). 

#### Saving all simulations
SONiCS can store the parameters and descriptors of all simulations. When run with **--save_report** it will dump the full report (with one simulation parameters and descriptors per line) into a csv file in the output directory. 

#### Choosing starting alleles
SONiCS can choose input alleles randomly or half randomly - one allele is always the one with the highest support. By default sonics run in half_random mode, that can be changed to random by specifying **--random**.

#### Support for partial alleles
* **-t, --strict n_strict** - Procedure when encountered partial repetitions of the motif while parsing the VCF file. Options: 0 - pick on random one of the closest alleles, 1 - exclude given STR, 2 -exclude given genotype. Default: 1

*Example:*
REF=11, MOTIF=GT, GT=0|54;1|27;2|914;4|15
* 0: 11|81;12|914;13|15 or 11|54;12|941;13|15
* 1: 11|54;12|914;13|15
* 2: exclude genotype from simulation pool

### PARAMETERS FOR SIMULATIONS

* **-r, --repetitions n_repetitions** - maximum number of repetitions per genotype, default: 1000
* **-y, --pcr_cycles n_pcr_cycles** - number of PCR cycles before introducing the capture step; default: 12
* **-c, --after_capture n_after_capture** - number of PCR cycles after the introduction of the capture step; default: 12
* **-p, --padjusted p_adjust_threshold** - threshold for Bonferroni corrected p-value of Mann Whitney U test of the log-likelihood distributions; default: 0.01 
* **-i, --lnL_threshold lnL_threshold** - threshold for max and 75th percentile lnL ratios
* **--add_ratios** - Semicolon separated additional ratios to be calculated and reported in the last column of the output file.
Example: 0.5;0.6;0.8;0.9 means that median, 60th, 80th and 90th lnL percentile ratios will be calculated and reported.

### PARAMETERS SPECIFIC FOR PCR

Parameters are chosen on random from the given open interval before each simulation. 

* **-e, --efficiency N N** - PCR efficiency default: (0.001, 0.1)
* **-d, --down N N** - probability of slippage down - synthesizing molecule with less repeats; default: (0, 0.1)
* **-u, --up N N** - probability of slippage up - synthesizing molecule with more repeats; default: (0, 0.1)
* **-k, --capture N N** - parameter describing efficiency of the capture step. Values below zero favor capturing shorter molecules; default: (-0.25, 0.25)
* **--up_preference** - up-stutter doesn't have to be more probable than down-stutter; default slippage_down > slippage_up
* **-f, --floor n_floor** - Parameter used in calculating the minimum number of STRs in a molecule for it to be included in PCR cycles. Default: 5

*Formula:*
min_strs = max(1, min(alleles_in_input) - n_floor)

where: alleles_in_input are expressed as the number of repetitions of the motif and n_floor is a parameter defined by this option. If set to -1 minimum  number of STRs set to 1.
